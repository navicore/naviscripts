personal scripts for vim and tmux and anything else I use
------------

Messy - created slowly over many years.  I'm not even sure what most of them
even do but I can't live without them all.

* More vim8 than nvim but I use both and the setup works for both.
* More osx than Linux but I use both and the setup works for both.
* zsh
* vundle
* tmux
* nerd fonts
* YouCompleteMe - brittle pain but still works best for me
* linting for es6, rust, scala, R, python

I periodically once every year or two try to move to better parts and I usually
revert.

### INSTALL

`git clone git@github.com:navicore/naviscripts.git`

`cd naviscripts`

`./install.sh`

* follow the tedious instructions at the top of src/vimrc to finish the setup

### update the repo from the installed files

`./update_git.sh`

`git commit -a -m "my updates"`

`git push`
